                            <p>For best results, we strongly recommend 
                                starting with whole bean coffee and grinding 
                                with a burr grinder immediately before brewing. 
                                If you grind your coffee too soon, it will quickly 
                                lose many of the compounds that give it such 
                                delightful aromas and flavors.</p>

                                <p>While it may seem complicated, we think using 
                                    a scale actually makes brewing easier by 
                                    taking any guesswork out of the equation.</p>
